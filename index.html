            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the comh3any I joined. I honestly feel I

            amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
            found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
            weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as

            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
            The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
            hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
            next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
            often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
            developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
